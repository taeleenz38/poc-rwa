        Copiam&apos;s vision is to be the world&apos;s leading provider of FX
        and Debt Security liquidity to the main stakeholders in the digital
        asset ecosystem who trade in native digital “crypto” assets.
      </p>
      <p className="px-96 py-8">
        These stakeholders are predominantly Digital Asset Exchanges (DAEs), but
        also Digital Asset Projects, Digital Asset Custodians, specialist
        Digital Asset Funds and Wholesale Digital Asset Investors who trade in
        or manage native digital assets.

      <p className="px-96 py-8">
        The sheer number of investors in crypto now and associated trading
        volumes globally, plus the “normalisation” of crypto as an asset class
        (evidenced by various regulatory announcements) highlight a very active
        ecosystem currently underserved by Banks and the broader financial
        services industry due to prudential regulatory constraints and
        disruptive threats.
